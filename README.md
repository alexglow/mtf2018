Hacks for Music Tech Fest 2018: Pulsar Glove &amp; Planetary Beats

## planetary beats
Create custom binaural beats, at your desired pitch and pulse frequencies.  
Uses a Pure Data patch (.pd) with MobMuPlat GUI interface (.mmp). Airdrop both files to iPhone / iPad (or otherwise transfer), after installing MobMuPlat, then open the .mmp file.

## samples
3D immersive spatial audio (recorded with Hooke Audio binaural in-ear mics). Recorded in & around the R1 decommissioned nuclear reactor in Stockholm, Sweden.  
Also some ambient audio files downloaded from myNoise.net ("for personal use only").  
Designed in pairs to match different bodies of the Solar System, accompanying tailored binaural beats.
